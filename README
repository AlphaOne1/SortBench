#  Readme for sortbench  #
##########################

The sortbench is a benchmark framework for sorting algorithms. It already includes
some well known algorithms and is easily extensible. I would be happy to have more
contributions of algorithms, as there is a vast number available.

# Editing #

For editing I recommend vim or QtCreator (that luckily also has a vi-mode). The
code style is simple. Always use tabs to indent. Indent and tab size are both set
to eight. For easy beginning I included a style file for QtCreator and every file
has a modeline for vi on the top.

# Contributing #

The modules follow some simple rules. Every sorting algorithm is a class derived
from SortBase. Every module further defines to _C_ functions, create and destroy.
The benchmark uses these create and destroy function to contruct and destruct a
sorting algorithm class. For further details on the interface, consult the source
code and its contained documentation.

# Usage #

The main program, sortbench, has few parameters:

	$ sortbench <num_elements> <random_seed> <module_list>

(example: ./sortbench 1000 0 ./libHeapSort.so)
